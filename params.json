While you can participate in the workshop without these code snippets, having these will make participation much easier.\r\n\r\nMore info on the conference PSU Mac Admins is here: (http://macadmins.psu.edu)\r\n\r\nDownload a zip archive [here](https://github.com/gregneagle/psumac2014_python/archive/master.zip).\r\n\r\nOr git clone the repo:<br/>\r\n`git clone https://github.com/gregneagle/psumac2014_python.git`\r\n\r\nWe recommend you use a text editor designed for coding use during the workshop;  TextWrangler is free. Download it [here](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html).\r\n\r\nOther text editors that work well for this are [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/), [TextMate](http://macromates.com), and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com).\r\n\r\nThank you, and we are looking forward to working with you at Penn State in July!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
